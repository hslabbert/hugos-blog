I've been working with technology since about 2006, first in systems
administration and then moving onto network operations & engineering.  Like a
lot of other techies out there, I spend a lot of my time learning about new
technologies out there, either for the fun of it or because I just need to make
the damned thing work!

Anyway, when I come across some little tidbit of information that's worth
sharing, you're sure to find it in here...as of now of course...what? Did you
think I was going to delve back through years and years of web history, forums,
blogs, white papers and KB's to toss them all in here? Well...maybe...we'll see
about that. For now, feel free to visit as often as you want.
