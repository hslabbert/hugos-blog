      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google is touting their Google Apps offering for business with a new post on the official Google Blog (&lt;a href=&#34;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/take-test-drive-into-cloud.html&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). The post presents a link to a gonegoogle.com site, which runs you through a calculator of how much cash you can save by &amp;ldquo;Going Google&amp;rdquo;. The calculator seems to be based on industry averages for things like uptime, storage costs, remote access, etc., and presents a nice little summary poster at the end. An example is given from guest poster smartfurniture.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice little surprise comes up, though, when you click on the link to view the sample poster for Smart Furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bandwidth fail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://justanothersysadmin.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/docs-bandwidth-fail.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://justanothersysadmin.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/docs-bandwidth-fail.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm&amp;hellip;that&amp;rsquo;s not good. And if we try to click &lt;strong&gt;Download&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://justanothersysadmin.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/docs-fail-virus-scan.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://justanothersysadmin.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/docs-fail-virus-scan.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so good either&amp;hellip;but wait! There is hope! Let&amp;rsquo;s try to &lt;strong&gt;Download anyway&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://justanothersysadmin.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/docs-fail-forbidden.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://justanothersysadmin.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/docs-fail-forbidden.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh&amp;hellip;damn&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few different people check out the links from different networks and using different Google accounts, and all of them had the same result. With that being said, maybe we all downloaded too much docs content recently (?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: I use a lot of Google products and services (Gmail; Docs; Android (HTC Magic running CyanogenMod 5.0.7DS); Chrome, as can be seen in the screenshots; etc.) and love them. This was just too funny to pass up! So, are you ready to Go Google? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE1: Google has changed the poster link to point to a dummy document (&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B2Rsgoiin0I9NjAxYzM3YzAtMjExOC00ZDg1LTkxYWMtYmI1M2RmMzU5ZTYy&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) for &lt;em&gt;Acme Inc&lt;/em&gt;. Nice one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in case you were curious, the previous sample poster for Smart Furniture is still available (&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B2Rsgoiin0I9NmFmNTIwOWEtNjdhMy00YWI2LWJmNmUtNDNlOGRkODcyNDBl&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). My guess is that, as per the initial warning page, posting the PDF for Smart Furniture resulting in them tripping over a bandwidth limit for non-Google format docs for the Smart Furniture Google Apps account. Google probably reset the counter for Smart Furniture, since the original sample doc from them is now accessible, and then generated the dummy Acme Inc. sample page, hosting it within a Google Docs account that is not under the same bandwidth restrictions (internal account?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I guess this has become a &amp;ldquo;nothing to see here, move along!&amp;rdquo; post at this point, but the screenshots still tell the tale of a nice &amp;ldquo;oops!&amp;rdquo; on this campaign. If you share out a Google doc publicly, apparently you won&amp;rsquo;t want it to become too popular lest you hit your cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE2: The links may have been updated to the Acme Inc. dummy company, but the images and text in the post still reference Smart Furniture. I&amp;rsquo;m just nitpicking at this point, though, since the numbers they plugged in for Acme Inc. match those from Smart Furniture; I guess I just like being a little pain in the ass ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE3: K, so they have it all set now. The docs in the sample paragraph just below the video link to the Acme Inc. docs, but Smart Furniture image does now link to an actual Smart Furniture poster. Interestingly, the initial link for the Smart Furniture poster was HTTP, whereas the new link is to same item but over HTTPS, which may indicate differences in bandwidth restrictions between SSL&amp;rsquo;d and non-SSL traffic for Google Docs, or it could just be fluke. Anyhow: Well done to Google for this wrapped up pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In case it isn&amp;rsquo;t obvious: I switched up the theme for the site. I was never really too fond of the light-green touch of the previous theme and the code styling especially bugged me, but it was a fairly clean and so I just kind of stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow; comments &amp;amp; feedback appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Workaround for mysqldump SSL error 2026 bug #27669</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had not previously played aroung much with MySQL replication, but got the chance to do so recently. I&amp;rsquo;m doing some testing with a new mail filter setup composed of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/&#34;&gt;amavisd-new&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://spamassassin.apache.org/&#34;&gt;SpamAssassin&lt;/a&gt;, and some other SA modules running through &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postfix.org/&#34;&gt;Postfix&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.debian.org/&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; Etch. The setup uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maiamailguard.com/&#34;&gt;Maia Mailguard&lt;/a&gt; as a web front-end and management system, including per-user settings and quarantines. We&amp;rsquo;re using MySQL for the database backend for Maia for storing quarantines, per-user settings and the like, but wanted to have a dual-MX setup with a secondary MX sitting in a remote site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;So, we needed some way to keep the MySQL data between the two servers in sync. I had looked at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drbd.org/&#34;&gt;DRBD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linux-ha.org/&#34;&gt;linux-ha&lt;/a&gt;, but in the end decided to go with a dual-master &lt;a href=&#34;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication.html&#34;&gt;MySQL replication&lt;/a&gt; setup (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.neocodesoftware.com/replication/&#34;&gt;howto1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lug.wsu.edu/node/545/print&#34;&gt;howto2&lt;/a&gt;), using the built-in SSL capabilities in MySQL to encrypt the replication traffic over the WAN. After a bit of tweaking, I got that going, but then noticed that I could no longer perform mysqldump commands on the databases when running the command locally. I got the following error message whenever I tried a mysqldump command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Got error: 2026: SSL connection error when trying to connect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t specifying any SSL parameters in the mysqldump command, though, and while I did configure the replication users to require SSL in their user setup, the mysqldump user did not have an SSL requirement. I got to the official MySQL bug report for this error(#&lt;a href=&#34;http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=27669&#34;&gt;27669&lt;/a&gt;) as well as the patch link. But to be honest, that didn&amp;rsquo;t really get me anywhere. The bug report indicates that this behaviour has been corrected in MySQL release 5.0.42, and I was running release 5.0.32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I updated the mysql-client package on a test machine to 5.0.75 and tried the mysqldump again; the same error still occurred. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to upgrade the actual mysql-server package as well, so I looked elsewhere for a fix. It occurred to me that, in order for the MySQL replication to use SSL, I had specified the SSL-related options (ssl-ca and so forth) in the [client] section of the global configuration file at /etc/mysql/my.cnf. As mysqldump starts a MySQL client connection, it would stand to reason that it uses the [client] configuration settings that it would find in the global config file, and hence would try to use SSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get mysqldump to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use SSL connections, but still wanted my replication traffic to use SSL. Since the mysqld daemon runs under the mysql user account, I moved the ssl-related config options out of the [client] section of the global config file of /etc/mysql/my.cnf, created a new .my.cnf config file in the mysql user&amp;rsquo;s $HOME directory (/var/lib/mysql on my system), and entered just the ssl-related options in a [client] section of that .my.cnf file. I reloaded the mysqld daemon and confirmed that the slave connection to the remote server came up properly. It did; the configuration options for the mysql user includes both the global config file of /etc/mysql/my.cnf and the per-user .my.cnf file I had just created, so it is able to pick up the ssl-related options in the [client] section of the per-user settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The ssl-related options I am talking about here are only those configured in the [client] section. The ssl-related options in the [mysqld] section of the global config file can stay where they are. It should work to have those present in the local mysql user&amp;rsquo;s .my.cnf config file, but I did not test this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since no ssl-related options were specified in the global [client] configuration anymore, and no per-user settings were present for the user I was using for the mysqldump command, the command connected without SSL, the SSL error 2026 messages went away, and I was again able to successfully perform MySQL backups from the local machine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accessing Active Directory in PHP using ADLDAP</title>
      <link>https://bamboo.slabnet.com/~hslabbert/blog/post/accessing-active-directory-in-php-using-adldap/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2008 05:35:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>hugo@slabnet.com (Hugo Slabbert)</author>
      <guid>https://bamboo.slabnet.com/~hslabbert/blog/post/accessing-active-directory-in-php-using-adldap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, our company has started developing user web portals for our clients. The main goal is to provide a central reference point for common links (webmail, helpdesk, remote assistance links &amp;hellip; ), howto documents, and other files and resources. A secondary goal was to also allow user administrators to perform basic user management through a web interface. This would include things like disabling/creating/unlocking user accounts, resetting passwords, and modifying group memberships for access reasons. Myself and the other admin tasked with setting up this portal are most familiar with PHP, and so we went of looking for the best means of interfacing with Active Directory through PHP. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can obviously use PHP&amp;rsquo;s built-in LDAP support, provided PHP was built &amp;ndash;with-ldap. If you&amp;rsquo;re doing a lot of calls back and forth though, this can get pretty tedious pretty fast. It can also be quite intimidating to someone who is more of a sysadmin that a full-time developer (myself included!). So, abstracting away some of the complexity would be handy. I&amp;rsquo;m betting there are other systems out there, but for us, &lt;a href=&#34;http://adldap.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;adldap&lt;/a&gt; was the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adldap provides an easy-to-use interface for both querying and modifying Active Directory. This post is not meant to be a complete setup guide, but rather just an overview, so here&amp;rsquo;s the quick summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runs on Apache or IIS (although the documentation is a little thin on using IIS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might require some configuration in your environment to support secure LDAP queries over SSL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporates into your PHP pages through a class definition file. Configure the settings in the provided adldap.php file to match your environment, include() it in your php page, initialize an instance of the class (&lt;code&gt;$adldap = new adLDAP();&lt;/code&gt;), and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allows you to add custom functions by adding to the class definition file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some of that sounds scary, don&amp;rsquo;t worry: It can sound more intimidating than it really is. If you have some reasonable PHP background, just go and check it out and get your feet wet. Like I said: Both myself and the other project contributor are not full-time developers, but we&amp;rsquo;ve thrown pretty useful AD integration into the portals. Heck, we&amp;rsquo;ve even started incorporating some AJAX on the site (with some help from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prototypejs.org/&#34;&gt;Prototype&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;but that&amp;rsquo;s another post&amp;hellip;) to work with adldap and make the thing pretty slick overall!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that was getting at me a little bit was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just throw a custom ldap query string into aldap and get the results. Part of the abstraction is that you get a set of functions for querying for specific types of information: user_info(), user_delete(), authenticate(), group_create(), etc, but no raw ldap query function. So I checked out how the thing is put together, and I bastardized some of the existing functions to suit my purposes. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with ldap queries, add the following code into your aldap.php class definition file, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got yourself an easy way of performing custom ldap queries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;function any_info($filter=NULL,$fields=NULL){
// Written by Hugo Slabbert (JustAnotherSysadmin - http://bamboo.slabnet.com/~hslabbert/blog) from other functions; defaults to root
if (!$this-&amp;gt;_bind){ return (false); }
if ( $filter==NULL ){ $filter=&amp;quot;(&amp;amp;(objectclass=domainDNS)(!(distinguishedname=&amp;quot; . $this-&amp;gt;_base_dn . &amp;quot;)))&amp;quot;; }
if ($fields==NULL){ $fields=array(&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;cn&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;displayname&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;dn&amp;quot;); }
$sr=ldap_search($this-&amp;gt;_conn,$this-&amp;gt;_base_dn,$filter,$fields);
$entries = ldap_get_entries($this-&amp;gt;_conn, $sr);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;return ($entries);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do use the code snippet, I just ask that you keep the comments in tact. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind sharing, but I&amp;rsquo;d like a little bit of the credit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use the &lt;code&gt;any_info()&lt;/code&gt; function above, it takes two parameters: your ldap query (&lt;code&gt;$filter&lt;/code&gt;), and an array of which attributes you wish to return for the objects that match your query (&lt;code&gt;$fields&lt;/code&gt;). If you leave the second parameter blank, the default attributes of name, cn (canonical name), display name, and dn (distinguished name) will be returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, go ahead! Try it out! Let me know if it works for you and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t. I do have two final recommendations, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you run into technical difficulties getting adldap running properly, you&amp;rsquo;re probably better off going through their actual support (forums, documentation, etc.) than posting requests here. I&amp;rsquo;ve used the system, but I&amp;rsquo;m betting you will get way better support from the actual devs!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that the point of this tool is to enable access to your Active Directory through the a web interface. Secure your web app accordingly! Putting powerful tools on the web is great, but realize that you are doing just that: Putting POWERFUL tools on the web! You are the best judge (hopefully!) of what suits your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gmail Filesystem for Windows</title>
      <link>https://bamboo.slabnet.com/~hslabbert/blog/post/gmail-filesystem-for-windows/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2008 03:49:34 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://bamboo.slabnet.com/~hslabbert/blog/post/gmail-filesystem-for-windows/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an easy online storage solution for Windows (and have a gmail account kicking around), check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm&#34;&gt;Gmail Drive&lt;/a&gt; by  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.viksoe.dk/code/index.htm&#34;&gt;bjarke&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a free shell extension for Windows that basically adds a new drive to your computer. When you try to access the drive through Windows explorer, you are prompted for your gmail login details (you have the option of saving the details to avoid having to login each time you access the drive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File access seems to work similar to how Windows Explorer interacts with FTP folders. A right-click context menu allows you to create a new folder, but not new files as with a regular Windows disk or share. Files and folders you save in the gmail drive show up as messages with the file/folder as an attachment. The author recommends adding a filter to your gmail account that will automatically archive new Gmail Drive messages (they all start with a subject of &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;GMAILFS&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. I also added set the filter to add a label of &lt;strong&gt;GMAILDRIVE&lt;/strong&gt; for easy searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 gigs of free, easy-access online storage? Bring it on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JaS&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Update on Network Solutions Front-running</title>
      <link>https://bamboo.slabnet.com/~hslabbert/blog/post/update-on-network-solutions-frontrunning/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2008 18:37:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>hugo@slabnet.com (Hugo Slabbert)</author>
      <guid>https://bamboo.slabnet.com/~hslabbert/blog/post/update-on-network-solutions-frontrunning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you caught my previous post about Network Solutions&amp;rsquo; practice of domain front-running, here&amp;rsquo;s the latest bit: They are now actually claiming that this practice protects people &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; front-running (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;articleId=9056778&#34;&gt;CW article&lt;/a&gt; for more details). Their logic? Well, if the domain gets reserved when you search for it, they are preventing scammers from registering the domain and selling it back to you&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;uhm&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s try this again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I go to NS to search for a domain&amp;rsquo;s availability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;NS registers that domain so that it&amp;rsquo;s only available through them, but in no way is this reservation tied to me, the person who did the search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I want the domain, I &lt;em&gt;HAVE&lt;/em&gt; to buy it through Network Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If some scammer wants to snatch up the domain to sell it back to me at a profit, the only catch is that he has to register the domain through Network Solutions. He can do this because, again, NS has in NO WAY tied the search and subsequent reservation to only myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, even for PR spin that&amp;rsquo;s some pretty crappy logic in their excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have not heard of the term cybersquatting, here&amp;rsquo;s the gist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of a domain name that someone else is likely to be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Register/Purchase that domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait for that person to try and register the domain for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sell the domain to them for a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another spin on this idea is called domain frontrunning, where domain registrars track which domains are checked for availability (e.g. you searched for a domain that you&amp;rsquo;re interested in), and they snatch up that domain. They still show the domain as available through their searches, but other whois lookups or domain registrar searches shows the domain as already registered&amp;hellip;to the first registrar.This might sound confusing, but basically it means that whatever domain you just searched for through the first registrar is now &lt;em&gt;ONLY&lt;/em&gt; available through that registrar, forcing you to buy it through them and no one else. Technically, this is not illegal, but it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty underhanded way to do business. While I personally have never had any problems working with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networksolutions.com/&#34;&gt;Network Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, they are currently accused of this practice of front running.&lt;/p&gt;
