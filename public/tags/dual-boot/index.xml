      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t played around much in Linux lately, but I finally dusted off my Ubuntu CD&amp;rsquo;s and started tooling around again. I already had Vista installation on my work laptop, and did not want to blow that away, so I erred on the side of caution by not letting the Xubuntu setup program install its own GRUB bootloader&amp;hellip;except then I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get into the Linux OS&amp;hellip;
So, off I go in search of GRUB install guides, and just about every how-to out there is using the basic scenario that GRUB was installed in the first place, and that it just needs to reinstall itself, which was totally not the case this time around!</description>
