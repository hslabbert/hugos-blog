      <title>&#34;Gone Google&#34; Marketing Fail...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google is touting their Google Apps offering for business with a new post on the official Google Blog (&lt;a href=&#34;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/take-test-drive-into-cloud.html&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). The post presents a link to a gonegoogle.com site, which runs you through a calculator of how much cash you can save by &amp;ldquo;Going Google&amp;rdquo;. The calculator seems to be based on industry averages for things like uptime, storage costs, remote access, etc., and presents a nice little summary poster at the end. An example is given from guest poster smartfurniture.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice little surprise comes up, though, when you click on the link to view the sample poster for Smart Furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In case it isn&amp;rsquo;t obvious: I switched up the theme for the site. I was never really too fond of the light-green touch of the previous theme and the code styling especially bugged me, but it was a fairly clean and so I just kind of stuck with it.
Anyhow; comments &amp;amp; feedback appreciated.</description>

      <description>If you caught my previous post about Network Solutions&amp;rsquo; practice of domain front-running, here&amp;rsquo;s the latest bit: They are now actually claiming that this practice protects people against front-running (see CW article for more details). Their logic? Well, if the domain gets reserved when you search for it, they are preventing scammers from registering the domain and selling it back to you&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip;uhm&amp;hellip;
Let&amp;rsquo;s try this again:

      <description>If you have not heard of the term cybersquatting, here&amp;rsquo;s the gist:
 Think of a domain name that someone else is likely to be interested in.
 Register/Purchase that domain.
 Wait for that person to try and register the domain for themselves.
 Sell the domain to them for a profit.
  Another spin on this idea is called domain frontrunning, where domain registrars track which domains are checked for availability (e.</description>
