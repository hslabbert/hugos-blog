      <description>This topic has been covered a bit (here, here, and here, for instance) but I have been working on a project that utilizes Virtual Server for testing, and it came up again. A consultant that was working on the VM&amp;rsquo;s in question apparently struggled for quite some time before he asked for help on it. So, I thought I would see if another post on this might help someone out.</description>

      <description>If you have ever had to take on a Physical-to-Virtual (P2V) migration of a server or other machine, you know that you generally have a fine balance of the following triangle of factors: cost, complexity, and reliability. It seems like the only way to get an easy and reliable solution is to throw gobs of money at either a VMWare infrastructure or something like Platespin. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: from what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard they both offer excellent solutions in that field, but it simply isn&amp;rsquo;t cheap.</description>
