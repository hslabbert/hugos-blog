      <description>Every now and then somebody asks me if there is some way around paying Adobe hundreds and hundreds of dollars if they just want to create some PDF&amp;rsquo;s. Answer? Absolutely!
Two free PDF printers you can use are CutePDF and PDFCreator. I have not used the latter, but I use CutePDF myself, have recommended CutePDF to several people, and have not had any problems with it.
If you are looking for a bit more functionality, such as creating a single PDF from multiple PDF&amp;rsquo;s, rearranging pages or adding/removing pages, converting PDF&amp;rsquo;s to MS Office documents, etc, be sure to check out PDF Converter Pro from Nuance Software.</description>
